# Netflix-Movies-And-TVShow-Clustering

We have also built a recommender system using several libraries in python, and we have deployed our app on the hugging face platform, also please note that one file named cosine_sim.pkl is missing in this github repository because it was too large to upload. You can download that file from my hugging-face space.

Here's the link to the working app -: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Harsh12/Netflix-Movie-Recommender
